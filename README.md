Day 5 - Beginner Python Loops

In here, discussion revolves around for loops and using the range function and using a list. Here's a way on how we can convert a string list into an integer list.

range - gives a range of values/numbers to loop through.

range(start, stop, end)

Note: In stop, that number WILL NOT BE INCLUDED

So. range(1, 10)  will be just 1 -9

Exercises: Average height (finding the average value without using the MAX function), High Score (finding the maximum value without using the MAX function)
, Adding Even Numbers (through use of for loops and range), FizzBuzz (when number is 3, you should say Fizz, if 5, Buzz, if number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should be FizzBuzz)

Project: Password Generator
This ask for a number of letters, symbols and passwords for a user and generate a password out of it. It has two levels of difficulty. Easy - the order of letters, symbols and passwords for every tries would be the same. Hard - each password generation would have a different order.
